                  <h4>Jim David</h4>
                  <h5>Founder & CEO</h5>
                  <p>
                    Jim McDavid has 30 years of broad expertise and leadership in Sales, Service, F&I, and Dealer Operations. After serving in the Navy, Jim began his automotive career in 1979 in Birmingham, Alabama. In an eight-year period, he worked for two dealerships and was promoted within each organization to leadership positions such as Lease Manager, Finance Manager, Sales Manager, and General Sales Manager.</p>
                  <p>
                    In 1988, Jim joined JM Family Enterprises at The JM&A Group, where he held the positions of District Manager, Regional Manager, and Divisional Manager. He was promoted to Zone Vice President for the Southwest in 2001; in just two years, he developed new initiatives that increased sales and profitability, while steadily expanding JM&A’s success in Dealership Consulting in 10 states. In 2003, Jim was selected to assume nationwide responsibility with his promotion to Vice President, North America Sales.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After leaving JM&A in 2009, Jim began incubating several major projects. The result was the launch of MobiDrives and an ownership interest in Rocky Top Chrysler Dodge Jeep in Sevierville, Tennessee. In 2011, The McDavid Group was launched as the capstone to Jim’s organization.</p>
